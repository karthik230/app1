A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
Ex: 1991, 2002, 9999, 8998

The largest palindrome made from the product of any two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.






Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
What is an happy number can be shown in the following example:
19 is a happy number
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
