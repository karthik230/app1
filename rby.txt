we will need sql concepts
there are different types of associations like one to one and one to many and many to one are the associations as of now i know 
we have to model the database as of now

Automobile store
We have to resources here Cusotomers and Autos.
   Customers 
   - name, email, phone

    1, name1, name1@gmail.com, 111-111-1111
    2, name2, name2@gmail.com, 111-111-1112
    3, name3, name3@gmail.com, 111-111-1113
 
  Autos
   - make, model, year , vin, customer_id

   honda, civic, 2011, 344343434343, 1
   toyota, camry, 2012, 343434343, 1
   lexus, rx350, 2014, 32322424, 3
   bmw, 328i, 2011, 2332322223,2

 we can probably do one thing, so that this car owner is this guy
basically repeating the data here, update the phone number we have to update it everywhere
so repetition is not encouraged. so we wil add foreign key. unique key is the id key
id column called as primary key
so with a primary key we can actually retrieve 

vin is the primary key in the Autos table. unique key is the primary key

so now all i can do is rails new automobile_store
cd automobile_store
rails g scaffold Customer name:string email:string phone:string
rails g scaffold Auto name 
rails convention is calling  customer_id
this data is being sent back the data
